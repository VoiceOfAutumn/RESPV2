              At Retro eSports, our mission is to celebrate classic games through competition â€” not to chase profits.

              This project is powered by passion, nostalgia, and a belief that retro gaming deserve a competitive space that feels authentic and community driven.
              While we're not here to make money, running Retro eSports still comes with real-world costs. Things like:
              <ul>
                ðŸ’» Server hosting and maintenance
              </ul>
              <ul>
                ðŸŽ¥ Media production (graphics, streams, edits)
              </ul>
              <ul>
                ðŸ›  Quality-of-life improvements to the website and platform
              </ul>
              <ul>
                âš¡ Bandwidth, storage, and third-party tools
              </ul>
              We gratefully accept financial support from the community to help us break even and keep the project running smoothly. Every bit helps â€” and everything we receive goes directly toward keeping Retro eSports alive and improving the experience for everyone.
